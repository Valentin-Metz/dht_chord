# Final report

We aim to provide production quality documentation,
as it would be expected for a releasable crate.

As declared in our initial report,
we therefore provide a *browsable* documentation with `rustdoc`,
as is customary in the rust ecosystem.

For your convenience, we host this documentation on our [gitlab repository](https://gitlab.lrz.de/netintum/teaching/p2psec_projects_2023/DHT-2/-/jobs/artifacts/master/file/target/doc/p2p_dht/index.html?job=documentation).
