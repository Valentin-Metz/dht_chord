//! Communication between peers
//!
//! We are using a data serialization library called "[channels-rs](https://crates.io/crates/channels)" to serialize and
//! deserialize our data.
//! This library allows us to transmit a struct/enum over TCP directly.
//!
//! Packet layout:
//!
//! ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threadexio/channels-rs/master/spec/assets/packet-diagram-dark.svg)
//!
//! The exact protocol specification can be found [here](https://github.com/threadexio/channels-rs/blob/master/spec/PROTOCOL.md).
//!
//! More importantly, this means that we do *not* have to interact with a raw byte-level TCP socket.
//! Instead, we simply transmit and match a [`PeerMessage`].
