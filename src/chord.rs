//! Implementation of a distributed hash table based on [Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(peer-to-peer))
//!
//! It can operate independently from the API module and is usable as a stand-alone crate.
//!
//! # Features:
//! - Key-Value storage
//! - Distributed, if more than one node available (but fully functional with one node only)
//! - Built-in replication
//! - IPv4 and IPv6 support
//! - Automatic node discovery
//! - Stabilization if nodes leave or join
//! - Housekeeping thread to remove expired entries and refresh
//! - Completely asynchronous and multi-threaded
//! - Requests from the API and from other nodes are processed and answered concurrently
//! - Free of race conditions due to Rusts ownership model
//! - Performance optimized implementation, capable of starting a fully functional network with 2000
//! nodes in under 10 seconds on a standard desktop computer (without PoW)
//!
//! # Security measures:
//! - [SHA-3-512](https://docs.rs/sha3/0.10.8/sha3/) proof of work challenges with adjustable difficulty for requests
//!     - Does not prevent [byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault) nodes from splitting the network or eclipsing nodes,
//!     but prevents greedy nodes from abusing the storage system
//!     - Difficulty is independently adjustable for each request type
//!     - Currently we maintain two difficulty settings,
//!     one for get requests and one for (potentially disruptive) write/storage requests
//! - Addresses of nodes assigned based on hash of IP + port
//!     - This could be easily adjusted to only hash IPs,
//!     providing limited [sybil defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack)
//!     - In case of IPv6, we could only hash a masked version of the IP
//!     - We have currently not implemented this,
//!     as it would interfere with development and testing
//! - Limited defence against nodes refusing to store values or disconnecting
//!     - Our housekeeping thread continuously refreshes values that have been stored in the DHT upon our own request
//!
//! # Security evaluation: // todo
//! - The inherent structure of the overlay offers some limited defense against id mapping attacks
//!     - It is not easily possible to fool the peers around the intimidated identity, as they are already in direct contact
//!     - Other nodes usually try to route requests as fast as possible into proximity of the intimidated identity
//! - Likewise the finger table offers resistance against eclipse attacks
//!     - Nodes regularly check in with all their fingers, which makes it hard to eclipse them fully with ongoing churn
//!  - Stabilization method, which regularly checks the health of peers in neighborhood and fixes the overlay if necessary
//!  - Storage and Retrieval attacks are partially mitigated by built in replication
//!  - Inconsistent behaviour also partially mitigated by built in replication
//!  - DoS Attacks such as content pollution and index poisoning are hardened against by PoW for insertion of values
//!
//! # Future Work
//!
//! ## improve Sybil defence
//!     - It would likely sensible to introduce further hardware such as bandwidth(with respective scanners)
//!     - New nodes should be treated differently, i.e. not as trustworthy until they stayed some time in the network
//!     - This would also help with other attacks
//!
//! ## Misbehaviour defence
//! Currently only crash faults are dealt with. Malicious faults will go undetected.
//! Local nodes could determine if a peer is misbehaving and exclude it from the overlay.
//! However peers know their neighbors and could therefore act differently to different peers.
//! Defending against such behaviour is hard, as for example a reporting system or similarly can
//! be abused by malicious peers to get "good" nodes excluded from the network.
//!
//! ## Better Stabilize
//! Stabilize in its current form relies on each node to realize that a peer disconnected from the network
//! This sometimes incorrectly invalidates `SetPredecessor` and `SetSuccessor` Requests, as they are
//! denied on the grounds that the receiving node does not know yet that its current successor/predecessor
//! no longer exists
//!
//! # Work Distribution
//! # Effort Spend
